This is the python version of the PET (Positron Emission Tomography) singularity results proved in the second part of my thesis.

In the thesis, I have showed that theoretically, the boundaries of the region of interests in a PET scan can be recovered by PET data only (instead of doing another CT scanning for data correction).

We show some numerical demonstrations here.
